\section{Introduction}

In this report, we will detail our results on the analysis of MIPS code execution.

\section{Warm up}

Nothing to do here

\section{Pipeline}

There are many clues which show the processor is enabled to forwarding.

First, the statistics window tell us:
\begin{verbatim}
ALU forwarded values: 2 (from execute: 2, memory stage: 0, write back: 0)
\end{verbatim}

Then, the log window tells us, for instruction 13:
\begin{verbatim}
DEBUG [EXECUTE]: {FW} PC: 0x000011a0 forwarding changed value for ALU port A RS from:
0x0 to: 0xffffffe0
\end{verbatim}

But we can also tell that the processor does forward because of the pipeline window.
Indeed, the processor compute the following instructions:

\begin{verbatim}
    1. nop
    2. addui r29,r29,-32
    3. sw 28(r29),r31
    4. sw 24(r29),r30
    5. or r30,r29,r0
\end{verbatim}

So instruction $3.$ and $4.$  depends on instruction $2.$ which is executed at cycle $12$.
At instruction $13$, $12$ has been executed, but the result is not written back in register yet,
and $3.$ is to be decoded. It means that $3.$ is able to use the result from $2.$ before $2.$ has finished
to store his value.
